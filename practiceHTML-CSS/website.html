    <button>Hello hello</button><button>Hello2</button>
    <p>
      The p stands for paragraph, where we can input text like this. Buttons and
      Paragraphs are known as html elements. Syntax requires the values to be
      placed into the code as rules. The tag is what is inside the symbols and
      describe what we want to build. a stands for an anchor element, which is
      like a link.
    </p>

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Link to YouTube</a>

    <p>
      The href is an html attribute, which modifies how an element behaves. Must
      have a space between attribute and tag name, then equal and double qoutes.
    </p>

    <p>The second attribute dictates where the new tab will open.</p>

    <p>
      Quirks: extra spaces are ignored in html. Will learn how to deal with this
      later. Extra new lines also count as spaces as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Changed spaces at bottom to be 2 per tab. Can make permanent thru settings
      cog in bottom left. Search tabsize to change on all files.
