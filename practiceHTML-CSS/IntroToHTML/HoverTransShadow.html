      This file is about hovers, transitions, and shadows on buttons. We also
      shouldn't actually define heightand weight to our elements. Need to fix
      buttons with a thing called padding. This padding is the css box model.
      Browsers align according to text, need to add vertical align set to top to
      fix. The border may add an additional px on top and bottom so check for
      that.
